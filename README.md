## Project Title - Python Battleship Game
### Project Idea – The battleship game can be played in the command line.

If the first ship is at location B, say (2,2), then the next ship can't be adjacent or diagonally adjacent to it.

<b>Changes done are :</b><br/>
– The first ship will be chosen randomly.<br/>
– The next value which is randomly selected will be checked if there is a ship adjacent or diagonally adjacent to it.<br/>
– If yes ::  The randomly generated value will be discarded.<br/>
– Else ::  A ship will be added at the randomly generated value.
